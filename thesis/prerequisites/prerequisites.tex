\chapter{Conventional data structures and terminology}
Data structures in traditional contexts are \textit{homogeneous} collections of data, usually with a particular shape represented by an algebraic data type, with an associated set of \textit{morphisms}.
A homogeneous collection of data is a collection in which every element is of the same type.
Morphisms come in various forms, they essentially encapsulate the operations that can be performed on a data structure (or more generally an object).
Together algebraic data structures and their associated morphisms represent an algebra.
\begin{remark}
    In object oriented programming data structures (an algebra) is most often implemented through a class while functional programming languanges often seperate the shape and operations.
