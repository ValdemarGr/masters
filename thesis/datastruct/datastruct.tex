\chapter{Practical data structures}
Throughout the previous sections we have used abstract representations for various collections such as evironments in typing (\autoref{sec:types}) and heaps in reduction strategies (\autoref{sec:redstrat}).
To map the abstract representations to practical algorithms, we must materialize various collections as data structures.
Fortunately, the field of data structures and in particular, persistent data structures, is well researched thus it becomes a matter of picking a good fit.
Data structures, like evaluation strategies (\autoref{sec:es}), come in both lazy and eager variants, of which we will interest ourselves with eager variants.
All data structures are to be considered subject to eager evaluation.

%Generally, a data structure involves two components; a shape and a set of operations.

%Data structures in traditional contexts are \textit{homogeneous} collections of data, usually with a particular shape represented by an algebraic data type, with an associated set of \textit{morphisms}.
%A homogeneous collection of data is a collection in which every element is of the same type.
%Morphisms come in various forms, they essentially encapsulate the operations that can be performed on a data structure (or more generally an object).
%Algebraic data structures and their associated morphisms come together into an algebra.
%\begin{remark}
    %In object oriented programming data structures (an algebra) is most often implemented through a class while functional programming languages often separate the shape and operations.
%\end{remark}

%Conventional data structures encapsulates data structures which are interesting under the call by value (\autoref{sec:es}) evaluation strategy.
%Evaluation strategies have many implications on the data structure in question.
%In call by name or call by need one would have to be careful not to create an unnecessary dependency which may force a computation which could otherwise stay suspended.
%The choice of evaluation strategy and data structure implementation has a significant impact on complexity analysis, which will be explored.
