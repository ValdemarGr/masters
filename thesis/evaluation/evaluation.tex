\chapter{Program evaluation}\label{sec:eval}
The untyped lambda calculus may provide a simple interface for programming, but does not pair very well with the modern computer.
\textit{Interpreting} is a common technique for evaluating the untyped lambda calculus.
An interpreter is an algorithm, usually implemented in a more low-level language, which interprets a program; essentially a program that runs a program.

Throughout this section, we will first consider various evaluation strategies and then consider how one evaluates the lambda calculus.
%Some machines keeps the lambda calculus typed for tasks such as evaluation
%Formally an interpreter for the untyped lambda calculus is a confluent catamorphism on a program, which sounds like \textit{abstract nonsense}, so let us delve into the details.
