\chapter{Program evaluation}
The untyped lambda calculus may provide a simple interface for programming but does not pair very well with the modern computer.
\textit{Interpreting} is a common technique for evaluating the untyped lambda calculus.
An interpreter is an execution engine usually implemented in a more low-level language.
%Formally an interpreter for the untyped lambda calculus is a confluent catamorphism on a program, which sounds like \textit{abstract nonsense}, so let us delve into the details.
