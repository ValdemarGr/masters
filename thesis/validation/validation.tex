\chapter{Typing and validation}
Automatic validation is one of many reasons to use computers for solving various tasks including writing new computer programs.
Spellchecking is a common and trivial instance of an input validation algorithm. 
The spell checking equivalent for computer programs could be type checking; a subproblem of validating a programmer's intuition of a program's intent.

Types can take properties that make them very powerful since types are, in their essence, a set of logical formulas in which we can use natural deduction to prove their validity~\cite{howard1980formulae}.
In fact, type systems are children of findings in the field of logic~\cite{wadler2015propositions}.
