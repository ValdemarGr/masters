\chapter{Programming languages}
Computers are devices which read a well-defined, finite sequence of simple instructions and emit a result.
In theoretical analysis of computers, models have been developed to understand and prove properties.
A finite sequence of instructions fed to a computer is called an \textit{algorithm}, which is the language of high level computation~\cite{copeland1997church}.
In modern encodings of algorithms or programs, ``high level'' languages are used instead of the computational models.
Such languages are then translated into instructions that often are much closer to a computational model.
The process of translating programs into computer instructions is called \textit{compiling}, or \textit{transpiling} if the program is first translated into another ``high level'' language.

For the purpose of this dissertation, a simple programming language has been implemented to illustrate the concepts in detail.
The language transpiles to \textit{untyped lambda calculus}.
For the remainder, the language will be refered to as $L$.
