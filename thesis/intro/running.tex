\subsection{Running and sources}
The compiler and interpreter for the programming language implemented in this thesis was written in Scala.
To compile the compiler and interpreter, one must install sbt (simple build tool) and bloop (build server).
To run a compile and run a program the program bloop must be invoked with the arguments \texttt{bloop run root -- /path/to/code/src/L/fib}, where the absolute path is the path to the file containing the code for the implemented programming language.
